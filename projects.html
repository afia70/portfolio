          <h5>Assistance to Alzheimer’s Patient </h5>
Alzheimer's patients find it hard to remember recent events,
to reason, and even to recognize people they know. We have built an assistive tool for Alzheimer's
patients and their caregivers to provide support like health monitoring, assist to find lost items,
provide reminders to take medicine, and assist to monitor patient's location. It was a team project
and I was in the lead. This was an interface between software and hardware.

          <h5>Hall Complaint Management System</h5>
Students living in hall/hostel face many issues for which they need to make a complaint. The manual process may become time consuming and erroneous. We made a website which is able to handle all types of hall complaints. It was a team project and I
was in the lead. Codeigniter was used as the platform where we integrated Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, PHP.

It takes a lot of time for claiming transfer and daily allowances. Moreover unfair means are adopted by the clerks. For eliminating these limitations, we built a web application which handle these allowances in a short span of time without any unfair means. It was a group project and I was in the lead. I used Codeigniter as the platform where I integrated Bootstrap,
HTML, CSS, php.

          <h5>Hunger’s Hope: Your Food, Their Smile </h5>

This was an Android team project. In restaurants,weddings, different parties, hostels, a lot of untouched food are left to rot and just thrown away where these food had so many potentials to feed many who are in need. So our idea is to let people
know that they have the option to utilize these extra foods rather than throwing it away and providing food to those who are in need of a meal or craves to have a good meal at least once. So, we built an android application which can become a bridge between the needy and the food donors who have extra food to share but not to waste.
